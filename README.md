# Library Management API

This project is a simple Library Management API built with **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** using Mongoose.  
It allows you to manage books and borrowing records in a library.

---

## What This Project Does

- You can add new books with details like title, author, genre, ISBN, description, copies, and availability.
- You can get all books with options to filter by genre, sort, and limit results.
- You can get details of a single book by its ID.
- You can update book details, like the number of copies.
- You can delete a book.
- You can borrow books, which reduces the number of available copies.
- You can see a summary of all borrowed books, showing total borrowed quantities.

## Important Features

- **Schema Validation:** All data fields are checked properly (e.g., title and author are required, genre must be from a list).
- **Business Logic:** When borrowing, it checks if enough copies are available and updates the availability status.
- **Aggregation:** Uses MongoDB aggregation to show total borrowed quantities for each book.
- **Mongoose Features:** Uses instance methods to update book availability and middleware to log book saves.
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Get books filtered by genre and sorted by different fields.
